# Covid-19-prediction-using-X-Ray-images
 
 Overview - 
 This is a group mini project which was done for University courework by a team of 4 members. It basically takes the X-ray of a patient and tells whether they are Covid-19 positive or negative
 
 Motivation - 
 The motivation behind doing this project is simple. The new variants change and with them the symptoms change as well. But one thing that will remain common wiht all variants is harm to lungs which can only be detected by X-ray. Apart from predicting if the patient has Covid19, it also gives the probability of it. So that if there is a fault in the X-ray or it is just a severe case of Pneumonia, it shows less probability.
 
 Technical - 
 So we have used the CNN algorithm for training our Dataset. We took the dataset from Kaggle. After working on the data, we applied the algorithm, made the model to get the predicitons. The accuracy of our model is around 92 %. We have also made a web application with HMTL as the frontend and integrated it with python to build an application.
